MortScript is "just" an interpreter (similar to the runtime environment of Visual Basic), so there's no visible program that can be run for itself. (Except for the registration of file extensions when you run MortScript.exe, but that's unnecessary if you used an installer.)

You have to use downloaded .mscr or .mortrun script files, or write them yourself with any text editor (plain text, no Unicode!).  For beginners, writing own scripts might be a bit complicated.
You can execute those scripts by running them like any other application in the file explorer (i.e., just tap the file), or create a shortcut to those files in your start menu (\Windows\Start menu, or some localization) with the file explorer (or any other tool).

I don't offer any warranty for damages caused by this program (neither me nor the script authors are perfect...). Be aware that foreign scripts can do lots of dangerous things, just like any "normal" application can read or delete files, or send data via the internet.

MortScript is a script language focused on batch control, i.e. to run other applications and remote control them, and to do basic system operations, like file operations, registry modifications, and such. Due to this, only basic dialogs are available.

MortScript is freeware, i.e., you don't need to pay for it. However, modifications are not allowed.
I'd be glad about a small (or big ;)) donation as "thank you!".
